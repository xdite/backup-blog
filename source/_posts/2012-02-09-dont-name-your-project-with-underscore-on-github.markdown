I had a ruby project named "[bootstrap_helper](https://github.com/xdite/bootstrap_helper)", which has 43 watchers on Github.

I thought having 43 watchers is sort of popular. But there is a weired thing:  when I search keyword : "bootstrap helper", my gem is not in first page result.

Then I found I made a hugh mistake: Ruby naming convention told Ruby developer to name everything with underscore. So every developer names their projects with underscore.

But it's a giant SEO mistake: Search Engine treats snake_keywords as CamelKeywords. If your project's name contains  meaningful keywords, it won't be matched. Because "snake_keywords" means "SnakeKeyword" not "snake keywords".

It's really bad for SEO.
